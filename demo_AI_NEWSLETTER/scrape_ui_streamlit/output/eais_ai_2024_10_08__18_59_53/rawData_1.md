### Chatbot Demo: Local Private Semantic Search

#### A bot answers questions based on your private documents

The app can run locally. You can upload your local files to the app - and ask
questions.  
The app will use RAG semantic search and LLM to answer questions based on your
documents.  
  
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines pre-trained language models
(LLM) with external information sources (for example, uploaded documents) to
improve text generation.  
LLM (Large Language Model) is is an AI system trained on vast amounts of text
data to understand and generate human-like text.

###

What are the Olympic Games?

__

The Olympic Games are an athletic festival that originated in [ancient
Greece](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Greece) and were revived in
the late 19th century. They are the world’s foremost sports competition and
include athletes from all over the world.

###

What is the origin of the Olympic Games?

__

The first Olympic Games had achieved major importance in Greece by the end of
the 6th century BCE. They began to lose popularity when Greece was conquered
by Rome in the 2nd century BCE, and the Games were officially abolished about
400 CE because of their pagan associations. The Olympics were revived in the
late 19th century, with the first modern Games being held in Greece is 1896.

###

When are the Olympic Games?

__

The Summer Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games are each held every four
years. After 1992, when both a Summer and Winter Games were held, they have
been held on a staggered two-year schedule so that the Olympic Games occur
every two years in either summer or winter.

###

Where are the Olympic Games held?

__

The [International Olympic
Committee](https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Olympic-Committee)
chooses the location of each Olympic Games. The choice is based on
applications made by the chief authority of a city, with support of the
national government.

###

What are the prizes at the Olympics?

__

In individual Olympic events the award for first place is a gold medal, for
second place a silver medal, and for third place a bronze medal. Diplomas are
awarded for fourth through eighth places, and all competitors and officials
receive a commemorative medal.

###

Are the Olympic Games an overall benefit for their host countries and cities?

__

Winning a bid to host the Olympic Games has been considered a major boon for
any city, but not all agree. Proponents believe that [hosting the Olympic
Games](https://www.britannica.com/list/7-ways-hosting-the-olympics-impacts-a-
city) can increase valuable tourism, boost local economies, and grow a host
country's global trade and stature. Others maintain, however, that the
Olympics are a financial drain on host cities and force them to create
expensive infrastructure and buildings that fall into disuse. [Learn more at

Just how far back in history organized athletic contests were held remains a
matter of debate, but it is reasonably certain that they occurred in
[Greece](https://www.britannica.com/place/Greece) almost 3,000 years ago.
However ancient in origin, by the end of the 6th century bce at least four
Greek sporting festivals, sometimes called “classical games,” had achieved
major importance: the Olympic Games, held at
[Olympia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Olympia-ancient-site-Greece); the
[Pythian Games](https://www.britannica.com/sports/Pythian-Games) at
[Delphi](https://www.britannica.com/place/Delphi-ancient-city-Greece); the
[Nemean Games](https://www.britannica.com/sports/Nemean-Games) at Nemea; and
the [Isthmian Games](https://www.britannica.com/sports/Isthmian-Games), held
near [Corinth](https://www.britannica.com/place/Corinth-Greece). Later,
similar festivals were held in nearly 150 cities as far afield as
[Rome](https://www.britannica.com/place/Rome),
[Naples](https://www.britannica.com/place/Naples-Italy), Odessus,
[Antioch](https://www.britannica.com/place/Antioch-ancient-city-west-central-

Of all the games held throughout Greece, the Olympic Games were the most
famous. Held every four years between August 6 and September 19, they occupied
such an important place in Greek history that in late antiquity historians
measured time by the interval between them—an Olympiad. The Olympic Games,
like almost all Greek games, were an [intrinsic](https://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/intrinsic) part of a religious festival. They were held
in honor of [Zeus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zeus) at Olympia by the
[city-state](https://www.britannica.com/topic/city-state) of
[Elis](https://www.britannica.com/place/Elis) in the northwestern
[Peloponnese](https://www.britannica.com/place/Peloponnese). The first Olympic
[champion](https://www.britannica.com/topic/champion-English-history) listed
in the records was Coroebus of Elis, a cook, who won the sprint race in 776
bce. Notions that the Olympics began much earlier than 776 bce are founded on
[myth](https://www.britannica.com/topic/myth), not historical evidence.
According to one [legend](https://www.britannica.com/art/legend-literature),
for example, the Games were founded by
[Heracles](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Heracles), son of Zeus and
[Alcmene](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Alcmene).

At the meeting in 776 bce there was apparently only one event, a
[footrace](https://www.britannica.com/sports/sprint-running) that covered one
length of the track at Olympia, but other events were added over the ensuing
decades. The race, known as the
[stade](https://www.britannica.com/science/stade-measurement), was about 192
meters (210 yards) long. The word _stade_ also came to refer to the track on
which the race was held and is the origin of the modern English word
_stadium_. In 724 bce a two-length race, the
_[diaulos](https://www.britannica.com/sports/diaulos)_ , roughly similar to
the 400-meter race, was included, and four years later the
_[dolichos](https://www.britannica.com/sports/dolichos-running-race)_ , a
long-distance race possibly
[comparable](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/comparable) to the modern
1,500- or 5,000-meter events, was added.
[Wrestling](https://www.britannica.com/sports/wrestling#ref8012) and the
[pentathlon](https://www.britannica.com/sports/pentathlon) were introduced in
708 bce. The latter was an all-around competition consisting of five
events—the [long jump](https://www.britannica.com/sports/long-jump), the
[javelin throw](https://www.britannica.com/sports/javelin-throw), the [discus
throw](https://www.britannica.com/sports/discus-throw), a footrace, and
wrestling.

[Boxing](https://www.britannica.com/sports/boxing) was introduced in 688 bce
and [chariot racing](https://www.britannica.com/sports/chariot-racing) eight
years later. In 648 bce the
[pancratium](https://www.britannica.com/sports/pankration) (from Greek
_pankration_), a kind of no-holds-barred combat, was included. This brutal
contest combined wrestling, boxing, and street fighting. Kicking and hitting a
downed opponent were allowed; only biting and gouging (thrusting a finger or
thumb into an opponent’s eye) were forbidden. Between 632 and 616 bce events
for boys were introduced. And from time to time further events were added,
including a footrace in which athletes ran in partial armour and contests for
[heralds](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/heralds) and for trumpeters.
The program, however, was not nearly so varied as that of the modern Olympics.
There were neither team games nor ball games, and the
[athletics](https://www.britannica.com/sports/athletics) (track and field)
events were limited to the four running events and the pentathlon mentioned
above. Chariot races and [horse
racing](https://www.britannica.com/sports/horse-racing), which became part of
the ancient Games, were held in the
[hippodrome](https://www.britannica.com/technology/hippodrome-architecture)
south of the stadium.

In the early centuries of Olympic competition, all the contests took place on
one day; later the Games were spread over four days, with a fifth devoted to
the closing-ceremony presentation of prizes and a banquet for the champions.
In most events the athletes participated in the nude. Through the centuries
scholars have sought to explain this practice. Theories have ranged from the
[eccentric](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eccentric) (to be nude
in public without an [erection](https://www.britannica.com/science/erection)
demonstrated self-control) to the usual anthropological, religious, and social
explanations, including the following: (1) nudity bespeaks a [rite of
passage](https://www.britannica.com/topic/rite-of-passage), (2) nudity was a
holdover from the days of [hunting](https://www.britannica.com/sports/hunting-
sport) and [gathering](https://www.britannica.com/topic/hunter-gatherer), (3)
nudity had, for the Greeks, a magical power to ward off harm, and (4) public
nudity was a kind of costume of the upper class. Historians grasp at dubious
theories because, in Judeo-Christian society, to compete nude in public seems
odd, if not scandalous. Yet ancient Greeks found nothing shameful about
nudity, especially male nudity. Therefore, the many modern explanations of
Greek athletic nudity are in the main unnecessary.

The Olympic Games were technically restricted to freeborn Greeks. Many Greek
competitors came from the Greek colonies on the [Italian
peninsula](https://www.britannica.com/place/Italian-Peninsula) and in [Asia
Minor](https://www.britannica.com/place/Anatolia) and
[Africa](https://www.britannica.com/place/Africa). Most of the participants
were professionals who trained full-time for the events. These athletes earned
substantial prizes for winning at many other preliminary festivals, and,
although the only prize at Olympia was a wreath or garland, an Olympic
champion also received widespread [adulation](https://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/adulation) and often lavish benefits from his home
city.

# [Women](https://www.britannica.com/topic/women) and the Olympic Games

Although there were no women’s events in the ancient Olympics, several women
appear in the official lists of Olympic victors as the owners of the stables
of some victorious chariot entries. In
[Sparta](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sparta), girls and young women did
practice and compete locally. But, apart from Sparta, contests for young Greek
women were very rare and probably limited to an annual local footrace. At
[Olympia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Olympia-ancient-site-Greece),
however, the [Herean festival](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Herean-
festival), held every four years in honor of the goddess
[Hera](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hera), included a race for young
women, who were divided into three age groups. Yet the Herean race was not
part of the Olympics (they took place at another time of the year) and
probably was not instituted before the advent of the [Roman
Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Roman-Empire). Then for a brief
period girls competed at a few other important athletic
[venues](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/venues).

The 2nd-century-ce traveler
[Pausanias](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pausanias-Greek-geographer)
wrote that women were banned from Olympia during the actual Games under
penalty of death. Yet he also remarked that the law and penalty had never been
[invoked](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/invoked). His account
later incongruously stated that unmarried women were allowed as Olympic
spectators. Many historians believe that a later scribe simply made an error
copying this passage of Pausanias’s text here. Nonetheless, the notion that
all or only married women were banned from the Games endured in popular
writing on the topic, though the evidence regarding women as spectators
remains unclear.

## Demise of the Olympics

[Greece](https://www.britannica.com/place/Greece) lost its independence to
[Rome](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Rome) in the middle of the 2nd
century bce, and support for the competitions at Olympia and elsewhere fell
off considerably during the next century. The Romans looked on
[athletics](https://www.britannica.com/sports/athletics) with contempt—to
strip naked and compete in public was
[degrading](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/degrading) in their eyes.
The Romans realized the political value of the Greek festivals, however, and
Emperor [Augustus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Augustus-Roman-
emperor) staged games for Greek athletes in a temporary wooden stadium erected
near the [Circus Maximus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Circus-Maximus) in
Rome and instituted major new athletic festivals in
[Italy](https://www.britannica.com/place/Italy) and in Greece. Emperor
[Nero](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nero-Roman-emperor) was also a
keen patron of the festivals in Greece, but he disgraced himself and the
Olympic Games when he entered a [chariot
race](https://www.britannica.com/sports/chariot-racing), fell off his vehicle,
and then declared himself the winner anyway.

Romans neither trained for nor participated in Greek athletics. Roman
[gladiator](https://www.britannica.com/sports/gladiator) shows and team
chariot racing were not related to the Olympic Games or to Greek athletics.
The main difference between the Greek and Roman attitudes is reflected in the
words each [culture](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture) used
to describe its festivals: for the Greeks they were contests (_agōnes_), while
for the Romans they were games (_ludi_). The Greeks originally organized their
festivals for the competitors, the Romans for the public. One was primarily
competition, the other entertainment. The Olympic Games were finally abolished
about 400 ce by the Roman emperor [Theodosius
I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodosius-I) or his son because of
the festival’s pagan associations.

The ideas and work of several people led to the creation of the modern
Olympics. The best-known architect of the modern Games was [Pierre de
Coubertin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pierre-baron-de-Coubertin),
born in [Paris](https://www.britannica.com/place/Paris) on New Year’s Day,
1863. Family tradition pointed to an army career or possibly politics, but at
age 24 Coubertin decided that his future lay in education, especially
[physical education](https://www.britannica.com/topic/physical-education). In
1890 he traveled to [England](https://www.britannica.com/place/England) to
meet Dr. [William Penny Brookes](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-
Penny-Brookes), who had written some articles on education that attracted the
Frenchman’s attention. Brookes also had tried for decades to revive the
[ancient Olympic Games](https://www.britannica.com/sports/ancient-Olympic-
Games), getting the idea from a series of modern Greek Olympiads held in
[Athens](https://www.britannica.com/place/Athens) starting in 1859. The Greek
Olympics were founded by Evangelis Zappas, who, in turn, got the idea from
[Panagiotis Soutsos](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Panayotis-Soutsos),
a Greek poet who was the first to call for a modern revival and began to
promote the idea in 1833. Brookes’s first British Olympiad, held in
[London](https://www.britannica.com/place/London) in 1866, was successful,
with many spectators and good athletes in attendance. But his subsequent
attempts met with less success and were beset by public
[apathy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apathy) and opposition
from rival sporting groups. Rather than give up, in the 1880s Brookes began to
argue for the founding of international Olympics in Athens.

When Coubertin sought to confer with Brookes about physical education, Brookes
talked more about Olympic revivals and showed him documents relating to both
the Greek and the British Olympiads. He also showed Coubertin newspaper
articles reporting his own proposal for international Olympic Games. On
November 25, 1892, at a meeting of the Union des Sports Athlétiques in Paris,
with no mention of Brookes or these previous modern Olympiads, Coubertin
himself advocated the idea of
[reviving](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/reviving) the Olympic Games,
and he propounded his desire for a new era in international sport when he
said:

> Let us export our oarsmen, our runners, our fencers into other lands. That
> is the true Free Trade of the future; and the day it is introduced into
> [Europe](https://www.britannica.com/place/Europe) the cause of Peace will
> have received a new and strong ally.

He then asked his audience to help him in “the splendid and beneficent task of
reviving the Olympic Games.” The speech did not produce any appreciable
activity, but Coubertin [reiterated](https://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/reiterated) his proposal for an Olympic revival in
Paris in June 1894 at a conference on international sport attended by 79
delegates representing 49 organizations from 9 countries. Coubertin himself
wrote that, except for his coworkers Dimítrios Vikélas of Greece, who was to
be the first president of the International Olympic Committee, and Professor
William M. Sloane of the [United
States](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States), from the [College of
New Jersey](https://www.britannica.com/topic/College-of-New-Jersey) (later
[Princeton University](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Princeton-
University)), no one had any real interest in the revival of the Games.
Nevertheless, and to quote Coubertin again, “a unanimous vote in favor of
revival was rendered at the end of the Congress chiefly to please me.”

It was at first agreed that the Games should be held in
[Paris](https://www.britannica.com/place/Paris) in 1900. Six years seemed a
long time to wait, however, and it was decided (how and by whom remains
obscure) to change the [venue](https://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/venue) to Athens and the date to April 1896. A great
deal of indifference, if not opposition, had to be overcome, including a
refusal by the Greek [prime minister](https://www.britannica.com/topic/prime-
minister) to stage the Games at all. But when a new prime minister took
office, Coubertin and Vikélas were able to carry their point, and the Games
were opened by the king of Greece in the first week of April 1896, on [Greek
Independence Day](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Greek-Independence-Day)
(which was on March 25 according to the [Julian
calendar](https://www.britannica.com/science/Julian-calendar) then in use in
Greece).

## Organization

## The [International Olympic
Committee](https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Olympic-Committee)

At the [Congress](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/Congress) of Paris in
1894, the control and development of the modern Olympic Games were entrusted
to the International Olympic Committee (IOC; Comité International Olympique).
During [World War I](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I) Coubertin
moved its headquarters to
[Lausanne](https://www.britannica.com/place/Lausanne),
[Switzerland](https://www.britannica.com/place/Switzerland), where they have
remained. The IOC is responsible for maintaining the regular celebration of
the Olympic Games, seeing that the Games are carried out in the spirit that
inspired their revival, and promoting the development of
[sports](https://www.britannica.com/sports/sports) throughout the world. The
original committee in 1894 consisted of 14 members and Coubertin.

IOC members are regarded as ambassadors from the committee to their national
sports organizations. They are in no sense
[delegates](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/delegates) to the committee
and may not accept, from the government of their country or from any
organization or individual, any instructions that in any way affect their
independence.

The IOC is a permanent organization that elects its own members. Reforms in
1999 set the maximum membership at 115, of whom 70 are individuals, 15 current
Olympic athletes, 15 national Olympic committee presidents, and 15
international sports federation presidents. The members are elected to
renewable eight-year terms, but they must retire at age 70. Term limits were
also applied to future presidents.

The IOC elects its president for a period of eight years, at the end of which
the president is eligible for reelection for further periods of four years
each. The executive board of 15 members holds periodic meetings with the
international federations and national Olympic committees. The IOC as a whole
meets annually, and a meeting can be [convened](https://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/convened) at any time that one-third of the members so
request.

## The awarding of the Olympic Games

The honor of holding the Olympic Games is entrusted to a city, not to a
country. The choice of the city lies solely with the IOC. Application to hold
the Games is made by the chief authority of the city, with the support of the
national government.

Applications must state that no political meetings or demonstrations will be
held in the stadium or other sports grounds or in the Olympic Village.
Applicants also promise that every competitor shall be given free entry
without any [discrimination](https://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/discrimination) on grounds of religion, color, or
political affiliation. This involves the [assurance](https://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/assurance) that the national government will not refuse
visas to any of the competitors. At the
[Montreal](https://www.britannica.com/place/Montreal) Olympics in 1976,
however, the Canadian government refused visas to the representatives of
[Taiwan](https://www.britannica.com/place/Taiwan) because they were unwilling
to forgo the title of the Republic of
[China](https://www.britannica.com/place/China), under which their national
Olympic committee had been admitted to the IOC. This Canadian decision, in the
opinion of the IOC, did great damage to the Olympic Games, and it was later
resolved that any country in which the Games are organized must
[undertake](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/undertake) to strictly
observe the rules. It was acknowledged that enforcement would be difficult,
and even the use of severe penalties by the IOC might not guarantee
elimination of infractions.

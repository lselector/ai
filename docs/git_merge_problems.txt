If I have tried to do "uu" and got a merge conflict

    <some file> needs merge
    error: could not write index
    error: Pulling is not possible because you have unmerged files.
    hint: Fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm <file>'
    hint: as appropriate to mark resolution and make a commit.
    fatal: Exiting because of an unresolved conflict.

And you want to disregard your changes and just accept incoming,
then you can do the following:

Solution 1:

    git reset --hard HEAD
    uu

Solution 2:

    git merge --abort
    git pull --no-commit --no-ff

    --no-commit option prevents Git from creating a merge commit, 
    --no-ff option ensures that a merge commit is always created, 
            even if the merge could be fast-forwarded.
    After running these commands, your local repository will be updated 
    with the incoming files from the remote repository, 
    and your local changes will be discarded.

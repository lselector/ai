PRDs (Product Requirement Documents) - foundational 
document(s) outlining what a product or feature should do. 
PRDs serve as a "source of truth" for both human developers 
and the AI assistant

Content of PRD: 
  intro and problem statement; 
  solution or feature overview; 
  user stories and feature descriptions; 
  technical requirements and constraints; 
  acceptance criteria; 
  project timeline, tech stack, and user flows

Best Practices - use clear sections and headings, write 
concise, isolated user stories, list explicit acceptance 
criteria for each feature, keep the PRD accessible to 
the AI (within the project folder)

Additional files: 
  tree.txt or repo_structure.yaml, 
  README.md, 
  ARCHITECTURE.md, 
  etc.

Markdown (MD) files can contain Mermaid diagrams, 
for example: graph TD;A-->B;A-->C;B-->D;C-->D;

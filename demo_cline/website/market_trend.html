            <h2>Key Market Themes</h2>
            <p>The stock market is constantly evolving, influenced by economic conditions, technological innovation, geopolitical events, and shifting consumer behaviors. Understanding these trends is essential for making informed investment decisions.</p>

            <div class="trend-section">
                <h3>🤖 Artificial Intelligence & Technology</h3>
                <p>AI continues to be one of the most transformative forces in the market. Companies developing AI technologies, cloud computing infrastructure, and semiconductor chips are seeing significant investor interest. The AI revolution is creating opportunities across multiple sectors, from software to healthcare to manufacturing.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Considerations:</strong> Look for companies with strong AI capabilities, substantial R&D investments, and practical applications that generate revenue.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="trend-section">
                <h3>🌱 Sustainable Energy & ESG</h3>
                <p>The transition to renewable energy is accelerating globally. Solar, wind, and battery technology companies are benefiting from government incentives and growing corporate commitments to sustainability. ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) factors are increasingly important to investors.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Considerations:</strong> Evaluate companies' actual environmental impact, not just their marketing. Look for profitable operations and realistic growth projections.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="trend-section">
                <h3>💊 Healthcare Innovation</h3>
                <p>Biotechnology, pharmaceutical companies, and healthcare technology firms continue to innovate. Advances in gene therapy, personalized medicine, and digital health are creating new investment opportunities. An aging global population is driving long-term demand for healthcare services.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Considerations:</strong> Assess drug pipelines, regulatory approval timelines, and patent protection. Healthcare can be volatile but offers strong long-term potential.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="trend-section">
                <h3>💰 Interest Rates & Economic Cycles</h3>
                <p>Central bank policies and interest rate decisions have major impacts on stock valuations. Higher rates typically pressure growth stocks while benefiting financial sector companies. Understanding the economic cycle helps in sector rotation strategies.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Considerations:</strong> Monitor Federal Reserve communications, inflation data, and economic indicators. Adjust portfolio positioning based on the economic outlook.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="trend-section">
                <h3>🏠 Consumer Behavior Shifts</h3>
                <p>E-commerce continues to grow, though at a more moderate pace post-pandemic. Consumers are increasingly value-conscious while still spending on experiences and premium products. Digital payment systems and fintech are reshaping financial services.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Considerations:</strong> Look for companies adapting to changing consumer preferences with strong brand loyalty and pricing power.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Investment Implications</h2>
            <p>Understanding market trends helps identify which sectors and companies are positioned for growth. However, trends alone don't guarantee success – individual company fundamentals, valuation, and risk management remain crucial.</p>
            
            <p>Diversification across sectors and investment styles can help manage risk while capturing opportunities from multiple trends. Consider both growth-oriented and defensive positions to balance your portfolio.</p>

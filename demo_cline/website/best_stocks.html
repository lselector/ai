            <h2>Important Reminders</h2>
            <div class="reminder-box">
                <p><strong>Do Your Own Research:</strong> These suggestions are starting points for your research, not buy recommendations. Always investigate companies thoroughly before investing.</p>
                <p><strong>Consider Your Goals:</strong> Your investment choices should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.</p>
                <p><strong>Monitor Your Investments:</strong> Regularly review your holdings and stay informed about company developments and market conditions.</p>
                <p><strong>Think Long-Term:</strong> Quality stocks can experience short-term volatility. Focus on long-term fundamentals rather than daily price movements.</p>

Please create a simple static website in subdirectory "website"

The website will feature good stocks to buy.

The website name will be:

The website will be completely static.
Only html, css, a bit of javascript for navigation.

The pages:
   index.html - home
   about.html
   market_trend.html
   best_stocks.html

Please make simple navigation at the top.
Please make navigation reactive (convert menu to the "hamburger" menu for spones).

Please use a color theme using bright mostly blue colors.
Please use gradients ("liquid" looking theme)

Please keep all styles definitions on one file called styles.css

Please fill the pages with some text that makes sense.

I want the website to work from local server at port 3000
